# SPaReL
This is the demo source code of SPaReL, and the sorted code will be uploaded later.

Please refer to https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/spring for the construction of the AMR graph of the question

First, you need to preprocess each dataset. If you want to test on other datasets, you may need to write a file that reads sentences from different datasets, so that the AMR parser can generate the AMR graph.
